** basic visualization
** Selection of rsoi (region sets of interest)
** BASIC data processing in rsoi (ie, computation of temporal variation of spatial means of a given attribute

** Sample use:
    > filename = 'sample.npz'
    > piv1 = PIVLib.PIV(filename)
    > piv1.selectRegionSet(plotScale=100, rsoiID='set1')
    > set1 = piv1.rsoi[0]

* Class RSOI:
** Extracted from PIV, ie, RSOI = pivInstance.
