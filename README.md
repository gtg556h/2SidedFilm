Code for analysis of cardiac myocyte mechanical coupling

* 20150131: Discovered that set of libraries installed on 'Wilson' function appropriatel (on 64-bit Linux).  Will debup more later, but, for now, these are the libraries to use!!!  Put in directory 'libWilson'

* 20141107: Starting recently, javacv library load fails on OSX.  Reinstalled in Linux, current versions of everything, and it works!  PIV lib is system independent, therefore problem likely lies in javacv.  Try installing git repo version, not cached copy from PIV website!
