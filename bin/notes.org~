* Status:
** Everything works!
** Now, instead of writing PIV to PIV directory, write it to "<filename>_PIV/dat"
** Then, gen python scripts to make npz arrays, saved in "<filename>_PIV"
** Then, remove all unnecessary imagej generated images!



* Currently working on automating PIV output
* My (almost) functional script is processPIVTemplate.js
* Unfortunately, it is writing the SAME output filename everytime.
* Need to fix and incorporate as template!!!x
